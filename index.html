        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! I'm Joan Silvern, a creative and passionate front-end developer with a strong foundation in graphic design and a diverse professional background. Over the years, I've honed a unique blend of creativity, technical expertise, and people-centered skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a former flight attendant with Delta Air Lines, I cultivated an ability to anticipate and address the needs of diverse groups, ensuring seamless experiences even under dynamic conditions. My role demanded adaptability, attention to detail, and teamwork—all invaluable qualities I now bring to my development projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            My work as an executive and personal assistant further refined my organizational, communication, and problem-solving abilities. Coordinating calendars, crafting engaging marketing materials, and managing complex schedules required a balance of precision and creativity. These experiences translate into my capability to manage projects efficiently and meet client goals with finesse.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also have experience managing teams and mentoring colleagues from my time as a shift manager and administrative professional. This role taught me to break down large objectives into achievable goals, making sure every team member feels supported and empowered.
        </p>
        <p>
            On a personal level, my travels to over 20 countries, fluency in Spanish, and experience living in Spain have deepened my appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusivity. As a published author, I bring storytelling and an eye for detail to my designs. These elements help me craft digital experiences that resonate with a wide range of users and ensure accessibility for all.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am passionate about merging creativity and functionality to create user-friendly designs, and I thrive on crafting solutions that meet the unique needs of every project. Let’s build something beautiful and impactful together!

    <section id="diversity">
        <h2>Diversity Awareness</h2>
        <p>
            As someone with a varied professional background and a deep appreciation for inclusivity, I prioritize creating digital experiences that resonate with diverse audiences. My goal is to bring awareness and accessibility to the forefront of every project, ensuring every design is welcoming and equitable for all users.
        </p>
        <p>
            My understanding of neurodiversity, including autism, informs my approach to creating designs that are intuitive and accommodating for all. Being bilingual in Spanish and having learned the basics of five other languages allows me to appreciate and incorporate multilingual and multicultural perspectives.
        </p>
        <p>
            Having lived in Spain and four U.S. states and traveled to 20 countries, I bring a global perspective to my work. These experiences have shaped my ability to connect with people from all walks of life, further fueling my commitment to diversity and accessibility in digital design.
